# 58. BRAHMA


```
That which being developed and becoming everything, yet remains the 
same, is 'Brahma'. 
He within whom all the resources of the world-knowledge, love and 
activity-are spontaneous, and by the inclination towards whom the 
scattered lives of men and all the diversities of the world find a final 
solution, is the God of men! 
To know God is to know all or the Whole. 
He whose intense and active inclination for a Living Ideal, transcending 
time and space, has made Him into God normally; whose literature, 
philosophy and science, penetrating the scattered good and evil prejudices 
of the mind, have been meaningfully adjusted in the Ideal, is the true 
Master. 
He whose mind is filled with attachment for One, or the Truth, is honest or 
chaste. 
To adhere the mind thoroughly to the Ideal is called Holiness. 
When the mind is absorbed completely in conceiving anything thoroughly, 
it is called deep meditation or `Samadhi. 
Repetition of the Name makes man keen, and Meditation or 'Dhyan' 
makes him calm and receptive. 
To remain engaged in any single thought and to feel that which distracts 
but cannot break our continuity is 'Dhyan' or Meditation. 
To be displeased means to be scattered. 
Be keen but calm. You will feel everything. 
Attachment to One or concentrated inclination is called 'Yoga'. 
That which, being opposed by something, wants to establish itself is 'self'. 
To make the ego stiff is not to know others. 
Those who are satisfied with meaningful solution through meditating 
observation are Rishis', Sages or Seers. The solving and untying of all 
kinds of knots of the mind so that they become meaningful in One-is 
Salvation. 
The ideas and activities that lead man towards the Cause are Spiritualism. 
The decision by which the Inner Cause is made to blossom is real 
Judgment. 
That analysis which determines the real form of the object aimed at is 
Reason. 
The painful feeling that arises from a judgment of the merits and demerits 
of a completed act, and causes abstention from evil, is Repentance. 
The Place on going to which the knots of the mind are untied and solved is 
`Tirtha'â€”place of Pilgrimage. 
Doing that which preserves existence is Virtue. 
Doing that which makes one fall from existence is Sin. 
That which exists and has expansion is Real. 
That to conceive which the mind retains its being is Finite. 
That to conceive which the mind loses itself is Infinite!

Peace!                   Peace!                       Peace!
