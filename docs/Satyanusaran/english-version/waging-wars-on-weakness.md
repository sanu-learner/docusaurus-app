# WAGING WAR ON WEAKNESS

## SATYANUSARAN

```
First of all, we must wage war on weakness. We must be bold and brave;
for weakness is sin incarnate! Drive it away at once--this depressing,
blood-sucking vampire! Say--you are bold, the offspring of Might! 
Before all else, be daring, be sincere. Then it is clear you have the 
right to enter the kingdom of heaven.

    With the least weakness you cannot be truly sincere, and so long as 
your thoughts and words do not agree, the dirt within shall not be 
touched.
    Once word and thought become alike, the dirt cannot collect within.
Test.
