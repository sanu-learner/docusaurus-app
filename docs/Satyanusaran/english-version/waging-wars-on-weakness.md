# 2. WAGING WAR ON WEAKNESS

## SATYANUSARAN

```
First of all, we must wage war on weakness. We must be bold and brave;
for weakness is sin incarnate! Drive it away at once--this depressing,
blood-sucking vampire! Say--you are bold, the offspring of Might! 
Before all else, be daring, be sincere. Then it is clear you have the 
right to enter the kingdom of heaven.

    With the least weakness you cannot be truly sincere, and so long as your 
thoughts and words do not agree, the dirt within shall not be touched. 
Once word and thought become alike, the dirt cannot collect within. The 
hidden rubbish floats up in words and sin cannot remain within. 
Failure need not be weakness; to fail to try is weakness. If despite your all
out effort in anything, you fail to succeed, no harm; carry on; don't stop! 
That unblemished effort must carry you toward the goal. 
Weak minds are always suspicious. They can never trust. Their faith has 
been lost; so they are generally sickly, tricky, sensually inclined. For them, 
all of life is a burning. Ultimately joy and sorrow are dissolved in despair. 
What is pleasure, what is pain, they cannot differentiate. If asked, they 
sigh, "What's the difference!" Ever restless, their lives deteriorate in 
dullness.

Love and regard has no place in the weak heart. To be anxious about one's 
own distress, suffering or death on seeing that of others and to be broken, 
bewildered and distraught thereby is weakness. But the eyes of those who 
are strong are always seeking for a remedy in everything they do and in 
such a way that no one is shattered while in that condition. To find the 
remedy with love, as did Lord Buddha, is the sign of a courageous heart. 
Say not you are timid! Say not you are a coward! Say not you are evil
minded! Look towards Father! Speak fervently, "Oh, I am Your son. 
Within me there is no more dullness, no more weakness. I am no longer a 
coward! Never again forgetting You will I run towards hell with my back 
towards Your light crying, 'Darkness, darkness, darkness'!"
