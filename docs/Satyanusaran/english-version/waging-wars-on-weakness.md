# WAGING WAR ON WEAKNESS

## SATYANUSARAN

```
First of all, we must wage war on weakness. We must be bold and brave;
for weakness is sin incarnate! Drive it away at once--this depressing,
blood-sucking vampire! Say--you are bold, the offspring of Might! 
Before all else, be daring, be sincere. Then it is clear you have the 
right to enter the kingdom of heaven.
