# 35. FAITH


```
The conception that cannot be affected or overwhelmed by contradictory 
conception is Faith. 
If there be no faith, how can there be vision? 
Work follows faith. As the faith, so the work. 
Deep faith can do anything. 
Believe! But beware that pride, impatience or irritation do not come in. 
You shall achieve what you want. 
It is faith alone that can bring expansion and responsive consciousness. 
And doubt brings in sluggishness, irresponsiveness and depression. 
Faith is above reason. If you have faith, all reasoning shall support you. 
As you believe, so will reasoning and arguments support you.
