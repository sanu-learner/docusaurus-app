# 6. PROSPER IN 'SADHANA'


```
If you want to prosper in `Sadhana' (avowed activity), give up hypocrisy. 
With the hope of getting a good name from others, the hypocrite mainly 
deceives himself and due to his little faith, he deprives himself of the real 
gift of others. 
You may speak volumes, but you can never find real happiness unless you 
become truly elevated. 
The inner feeling does not come out in the words of hypocrites; so their 
faces remain cold even with words of joy. What can words do? The spirit 
does not throb within the heart. 
The sea of bliss is bitter -salty to the hypocrite. Though he goes to the 
ocean, he cannot quench his thirst. 
The simple man, like a swallow, has eyes turned upwards. The hypocrite, 
like a vulture, has eyes always downward. Be little, no matter, but keep 
your eyes turned upward. What is the use of being big, but like a vulture 
with eyes always looking down from on high? 
Be not a hypocrite! Don't be deceived and don't deceive others.
