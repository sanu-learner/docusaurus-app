# PLACE FAITH IN IDEAL


```
As is the Ideal in whom you place faith, so will your nature be formed and 
your vision too will be like that. 
Follow the faithful. Love him. Faith will embrace you too. 
"I have no faith": with this idea man only shrinks his faith. 
There is not a man who has no faith. As deep and lofty the faith, so high 
the mind, so profound the life. 
He who believes in goodness becomes good. He who believes in devilry 
becomes devilish.
