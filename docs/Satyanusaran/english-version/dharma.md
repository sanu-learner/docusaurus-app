# 8. STAY OF ALL EXISTENCE, 'DHARMA'


```
The stay of all existence is Dharma, and He is the Supreme Fulfiller. 
Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. 
Views may be many even as many as there are people. Still, Dharma 
cannot be many. 
In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, 
Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma, etc. is wrong; rather, they are 
so many views. In fact, there is no opposition in the views different views, 
the same way- feeling one in many forms. 
Each faith is for the expansion of avowed activity. That can be in many 
forms and as much as is gained by the expansion, so much the realization- 
wisdom. So Dharma is based upon realization- to be 'real' in nature.
