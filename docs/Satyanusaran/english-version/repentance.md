# 3. REPENTANCE


```
Repent, but see that you have not to repent again. 
When you will be repentant for your misdeeds, at that very moment you 
will be pardoned by the Supreme Father, and you will understand it by the 
heavenly consolation you find in your heart. That will make you 
courteous, peaceful and cheerful. 
It should be understood that he who repents but commits the same blunder 
again, must fall soon into deadening misery. 
To repent in words only is not repentance at all. It is rather an obstruction 
to feeling repentance at heart. When real repentance comes, all its signs 
express themselves in varying degrees.
