# 16. TRYING TO REMOVE THE PAIN


```
As long as you feel pain in your body and mind, keep trying to remove the 
pain of even an ant. If you don't do this, who is there more deficient than 
you? 
If you get a slap on your face and can say, "Who is beating whom?" then 
say that for another. Well and good. But beware! If you can't think like 
this in your own case, don't talk like this in the case of another. 
If you become secular at the time of your own difficulties, don't feign to 
be spiritual at the time of others'. 
Rather, be spiritual at the time of your own difficulties and secular at that 
of others'; even such a pretension is good. 
If you be a man, you'll laugh at your own grief and weep at that of others. 
If you dislike your own death, never hay 'die' to others.
