# 57. THE WAY YOU CAN HAVE


```
Don't regret for not having without doing in the way you can have. 
To become sad without doing invites a 'not -to -get'. 
To get, whatever it might be, one must learn how to get it and do that 
exactly. Is there anything more foolish than to become impatient to get 
without doing? 
Know it for sureâ€” "Doing is the mother of getting." 
Only when doing is in accordance with desire does success appear. 
The desired good of man remains hidden beneath his habitual 
superstitions, and the Giver of Good is punished only when conflict 
appears between the Goodness He gives and the habitual superstitions. So 
the Saviour is slandered in His own country. 
Nature reproaches those who would approach the Unsensed-with neglect 
and rejection of what is Sensed. 
Those for whom the Seen is coloured or humiliated by the Unseen are 
deceived.
