# 18. BE OUTSPOKEN, BUT SWEET


```
Be outspoken but sweet. 
Consider before you speak, but having spoken, do not evade. 
If you have spoken wrong, beware! Do not do wrong. 
Speak the truth, but don't bring destruction. 
It is good to speak good, but better to think and feel it. 
Surely it is better to speak enlivening words than deadening ones. But 
what is the use if they are not carried into action and feelings at the same 
time? The violin and guitar play well by the grace of the player but cannot 
feel anything themselves. 
He who speaks much of realization but shows no indication of it froths 
only. All his big talks are imaginary. 
The deeper you dive, the more unrecognizable you are. 
As the pomegranate bursts open just as it ripens, so the honest thought 
within you when mature will burst forth of itself. You need not show it by 
words.
