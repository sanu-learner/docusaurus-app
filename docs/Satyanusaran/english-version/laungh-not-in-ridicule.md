# LAUGH, BUT NOT IN RIDICULE


```
Laugh, but not in ridicule. 
Weep. not from self -addiction but from love, devotion. 
Speak. but for neither self- aggrandizement nor fame. 
Do not hide from a man any example of your character if it be beneficial 
to him. 
Let your goodness roll out in deeds. But see that it does not come out in 
words. 
Attach your inclination to good: you will become good unconsciously. Be 
absorbed in good ideas in your own way. 
Your feelings will bloom according to your aptitude. 
As evil thoughts are revealed through eyes, words, dealings, behaviour 
etc., so too good thoughts express themselves in the same way.
