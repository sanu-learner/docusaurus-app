# EXPANSION IS LIFE, LOVE!!


```
Pursue only that whim which follows conscience you must achieve bliss. 
Merge yourself in expansion, but don't be extinguished. Expansion is life! 
Expansion is love! 
The work which brings expansion or growth in the mind is honest work. 
That which brings superstition, prejudice, etc. in the mind-in a word, that 
which brings narrowness-is evil work. 
Don't do that work which makes your face gloomy when you speak of it to 
others. Usually, where there is concealment out of hatred, shyness or fear, 
there weakness is, there sin is. 
Do that avowed activity which brings love in your heart, and don't go near 
what brings cruelty, harshness and violence, even though temporarily 
profitable. 
Though you have gained such powers that you can move the sun and the 
moon from their courses, can break the earth into pieces or make all 
people wealthy, but if you have no love in your heart, you have achieved 
nothing.
