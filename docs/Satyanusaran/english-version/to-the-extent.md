# 51. TO THE EXTENT YOU ARE GENUINE


```
To the extent you are genuine, Nature shall honor you with endowments 
and provide you with Her appropriate privileges. You see this every day; 
then, what more do you want? Just try wholeheartedly to be genuine. Does 
the university honor anyone with a degree unless he has studied and 
passed? 
Don't propagate yourself, even by mistake, and don't request anyone to do 
it for you. Then everyone will hate you and will leave you. 
If you really have known some truth and if you think it is beneficial, speak 
to your utmost about it and request everyone to know it. If they 
understand, they will listen and follow you. 
If you have seen and understood Truth, it will surely burst forth in your 
thought, word and deed. You will know no rest until you are lost in it. Can 
darkness cover the sun?
