# 27. TO BE HUMBLE DOES NOT MEAN TO BE UNTIDY


```
To be humble does not mean to be untidy. 
Display does not imply eagerness. Rather, it is excessive unrestrained 
expectation of the heart. 
Selfishness is not self-dependence or independence, rather, its opposite. 
The more you serve people, the more you become the master of all they 
have. 
To be spirited does not mean to be in a fury. Rather, it is firmness coupled 
with modesty. 
A holy man is no magician; rather, a renunciator, a lover. 
Does a devotee mean a fool? Rather, a wise man with humble pride. 
To forbear does not mean to retreat, but to embrace with love.
