# SERVING MASTER THROUGH SERVANTS


```
Be on your guard and do not serve your Master through servants or by 
ordering anyone else. Don't be deprived of bliss. 
Disregard for children never appears in the mother's heart because she 
cares for them with her own hands; hence her love is so great. 
In serving the Master with one's own hands pride becomes light, conceit 
goes away and love grows. 
The Master is the materialized form of Bliss, and He is the Absolute. 
One must take the Master as one's own. When one thinks of mother, 
father, son etc., His face should also appear in the mind. 
It is better to fear His love than His scolding if I do any wrong, He will be 
pained in His heart. 
Always try to follow Him. Obey carefully what He says, and try 
unceasingly to plant that by practice in your character. That is `sadhana'.
