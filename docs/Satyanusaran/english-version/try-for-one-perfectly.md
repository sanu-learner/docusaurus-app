# TRY PERFECTLY FOR ONE


```
Out for one don't ask for ten. Try perfectly for the one; you shall get all. 
Surely you will gain life in the manner in which you give it. 
He who gives his life for love gains a life of love. 
Be inspired by your purpose and with serene mind forbear all. Then only 
shall your purpose be fulfilled.
