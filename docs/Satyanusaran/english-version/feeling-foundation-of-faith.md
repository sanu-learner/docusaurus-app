# FEELING IS FOUNDATION OF FAITH


```
Feeling is the foundation of faith. Arguments and reason can never bring 
faith. The lighter the feeling the shallower the faith, the less the constancy. 
Faith is beyond the range of intellect. Intellect is according to faith. There 
is 'yes' or 'no' in intellect— there is doubt. In faith, there is no 'yes' or 
`no'—there is no doubt. 
The less the faith, the more undeveloped and blunt the intellect. 
You may be a learned man; but if lacking in faith, surely you are no better 
than a gramophone record or an ox carrying a load of words. 
He who has no unquivering faith has no realization. And how can he who 
has no realization be wise? 
As much one's realization, so much one's vision and wisdom, and in 
wisdom is the firmness of faith. 
If you don't believe, you neither see nor realize, and if you see and realize, 
it ripens your faith.
