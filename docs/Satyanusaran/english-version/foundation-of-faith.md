# 36. FOUNDATION OF FAITH


```
Feeling is the foundation of faith. Arguments and reason can never bring 
faith. The lighter the feeling the shallower the faith, the less the constancy. 
Faith is beyond the range of intellect. Intellect is according to faith. There 
is 'yes' or 'no' in intellect— there is doubt. In faith, there is no 'yes' or 
`no'—there is no doubt.
