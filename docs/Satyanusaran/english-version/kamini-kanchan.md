# 4. ADDICTION TO 'KAMINI-KANCHAN'


```
Almost all the miseries men have in the world come from the addiction to 
`Kamini-kanchan' (women and gold). It is better to remain as far away as 
possible from these two. 
Lord Ramakrishna enjoined on everyone to remain far, far, far away from 
Kamini-kanchan. 
If 'Kam' (lust) be dropped from ‘Kamini’, ‘ini' (she) becomes Ma. Poison 
becomes elixir. And Ma is always 
Mother-never `Kamini. 
To add ‘gi' to Ma is catastrophe. Beware! Don't lose thyself taking Ma as 
'Magi' (fallen woman). 
Everyone's Mother is the Mother of the world. Every woman is another 
form of one's own Mother. Think in this fashion. 
If filial thoughts be not heartfelt, one should not touch women. The farther 
away from them one remains, the better. Not to look upon their faces is 
better yet. 
He who only wails, "My passion and pride do not go, do not go", will find 
they never go. One should become habituated to those activities and 
thoughts which have no scent of pride and passion; then the mind forgets 
them. 
If thoughts of passion and pride do not arise in the mind, how can they 
show up? The way out is to remain always absorbed in higher thoughts 
and activities. 
Investigation into the science of creation, mathematics and chemistry 
controls lust. 
Any kind of enticing conversation on ‘Kamini-kanchan' can bring 
attraction for them. So, the farther one stays away from such talks, the 
better.
