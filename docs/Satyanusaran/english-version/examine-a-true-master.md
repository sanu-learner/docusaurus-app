# EXAMINE A TRUE MASTER


```
If you go with pride to examine a true Master, a loving Sage or Saint, you 
will only see yourself in Him and will come away deceived. 
The test is to feel blessed in the Grace of a true Master by approaching 
Him without prejudice or preconception, with a loving heart, humility and 
as little pride as possible. 
He can never be tested on the touchstone of pride, but as if torn by the 
horns of a ram, He can be rent into pieces by real humility. 
As the sparkle of a diamond which remains in coal and dirt can only be 
seen after thorough cleansing, so also, He Who lives in society as an 
ordinary man, can illumine the world with His sparkle only by the 
washings of love. The lover alone can know Him; so keep the company of 
lovers and worshippers of Existence. He must manifest Himself. 
A proud man can examine a proud man. How can he fathom one whose 
pride is dissolved? He is as strange and queer to him as a wise man is to a 
stark illiterate.
