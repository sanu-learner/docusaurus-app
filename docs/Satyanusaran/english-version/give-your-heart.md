# 21. GIVE YOUR HEART


```
Give your heart. You need never retreat. 
Rely, and you shall never be frightened. 
Believe. You shall master the world within. 
Encourage, and try not to arouse fear. 
Have patience, danger will be crossed over. 
Be not vain. You shall not have to remain humiliated in the world. 
Confess your fault in anguish before you are accused. You shall remain 
untarnished, an object of affection to the world. 
Be restrained but fearless. 
Be simple but not foolish. 
Be obedient, but for that don't be weak-hearted. 
```
