# 43. WHAT IS KNOWN BY REALIZATION


```
What is known by realization is wisdom. To know is to reach the Absolute 
through discernment, and that is 'Veda'. Veda is the indivisible whole. 
To the extent one knows, one is a Vedist. 
Wisdom destroys confusion and gives discerning eyes to man. 
Wisdom indicates the real nature of an object. When one sees an object in 
a condition that reveals all that is to be known about it, one knows its very 
essence. 
Devotion tries to attach the mind to Truth. and what is realized from that is 
called wisdom. 
Ignorance creates anxiety for man, and wisdom gives man peace. 
Ignorance is the cause of grief, and knowledge is bliss. 
The greater your wisdom, the greater your peace of mind. As your 
experience is. so is your strength to live normally.
