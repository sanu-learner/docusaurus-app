# 47. NO CUNNING IS SO GOOD


```
No cunning is so good as simple honesty. Any person, whatever he may 
be, must be caught in this trap: "Honesty is the best policy." 
There is nothing so fascinating as 
What else is so attractive as love? There is no achievement greater than 
faith. 
There is no eye like wisdom. 
There is nothing else to subdue vanity better than hearty humility. 
What sacred formula is there like carrying out the commands of the Living 
Ideal? 
Move on! Go ahead! Don't get tired thinking about the path, or you won't 
be able to move.
