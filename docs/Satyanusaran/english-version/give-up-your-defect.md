# GIVE UP YOUR DEFECT


```
If you are unable to give up your defect even after knowing it, do not ruin 
others by supporting it in any way. 
If you be good yourself, thousands of people will be good seeing your 
example. If you be bad, you will find no one to sympathize with you in 
your distress because being bad, you have made your environment bad. 
Know this for certain: you are responsible for the present and futureâ€”of 
yourself, your family, your environment and your country. 
It is not right to start any activity with hope for name and honour. But to 
the extent you do any work unselfishly name and honour must serve you. 
What is done for the self is selfish. What is done for others is selflessness. 
Merely to ask nothing for self or others is not selflessness. 
Give away! Desire nothing for yourself, and you will see that everything is 
becoming yours.
