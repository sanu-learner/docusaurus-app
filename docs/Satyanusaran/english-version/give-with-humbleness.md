# 30. GIVE, BUT WITH HUMBLENESS


```
Give, but with humbleness and without expectation. Let the door of 
kindness in your heart be open. 
To give, counting it to be kindness, is a patron of vanity. 
Be grateful to Him who, as Master, receives your gift with humility to 
awaken the feeling of kindness in your heart. 
Encourage, console, and sympathize with him to whom you give, feeling 
his grief. Then according to your ability, give with kindness. 
Love will be achieved. Your gift will be effective. 
The less you drum about your giving, the better. You will be saved from 
vanity. 
Don't refuse anyone who wants. Money, sympathy, encouragement, 
consolation, or sweet words: give any you can. The heart will become soft. 
The desire for the good of others is the mother of one's own good.
