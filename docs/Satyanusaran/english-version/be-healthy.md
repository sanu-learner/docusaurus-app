# 32. BE WEALTHY, NO HARM BUT


```
Be wealthy, no harm. But be humble and charitable. 
If a rich man be proud, he becomes downed with distress. 
A rich man, arrogant and proud, generally lacks faith, and the doors of 
heaven do not open in his heart. 
A proud rich man is a slave to impurities; so he ignores wisdom.
