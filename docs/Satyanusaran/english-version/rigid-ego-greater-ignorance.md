# THE MORE RIGID THE EGO, THE GREATER THE IGNORANCE


```
The more rigid the ego, the greater the ignorance. The lighter the pride, the 
brighter the knowledge. 
Doubt is the messenger of disbelief, and disbelief is the shelter of 
ignorance. 
Remove doubts the moment they appear, and merge yourself in thought of 
the good. You shall become the possessor of wisdom and bliss. 
Wicked thoughts create heinous experience, ignorance or delusion. Give 
them up! You shall be saved from grief. 
The more addicted you are to the evil, the more obsessed you will be by 
selfish interest and overpowered by evil knowledge or delusion. And 
disease, grief, poverty and death shall rule over you; it is sure!
