# 23. TO BE BLIND


```
To be blind is unfortunate indeed but to be without a staff is even worse; 
for the staff does much of the eyes' work. 
Going to school only doesn't make a student, and taking initiation only 
doesn't make a disciple. The heart should always be kept open to carry out 
the orders of the Master or Teacher. Have firm faith within. Whatever He 
says must be done and that without objection or excuse-rather, with the 
greatest pleasure. 
The student or disciple who gives his all in carrying out the orders of the 
Master with pleasure is never disappointed. 
The disciple's duty is to materialize the commands of his Master and to 
move on, taking Him as the Ideal. 
Whenever you find that on getting any command from his Master the 
disciple is pleased and his face blooms, you will know that strength has 
come in his heart.
