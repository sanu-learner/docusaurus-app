# CONCEIT OF KNOWLEDGE


```
If you long for good, give up conceit of knowledge. Listen to everyone 
and do whatever helps to expand your heart. 
No other passion creates such a hindrance to knowledge as does conceit of 
knowledge. 
If you want to teach, think not you are a teacher only. "I am a teacher": 
this 'teach -conceit' hinders one from learning. 
As far away as you keep pride, so far your vision or wisdom expands. 
When the ego dissolves, then and there the soul becomes the possessor of 
all qualitiesâ€”the Absolute.
