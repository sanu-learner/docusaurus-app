# 48. HE WHO HAS JUMPED FIRST


```
He who has jumped first and shown the way first is the leader. Can empty 
words alone make a leader? 
At first, give up your all for others. Sell out your self at the feet of others. 
Forget to reckon the faults of others as faults. Be self -less in service. Then 
you are a leader. then you are the heart of your country, the king of your 
country. Otherwise, all this won't be achieved by words alone. 
If you wish to be a leader, give up the charm of leadership, give up self 
praise, stake your everything for the good of others, show them by doing 
yourself what is blissful and true, and speak of that to others with love. 
You will see how thousands will follow you.
