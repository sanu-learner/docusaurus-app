# 52. IF THERE IS NO TRUTH IN YOU


```
If there is no truth in you, you may speak a thousand times, even show a 
thousand tricks, pretend in a thousand ways; still the light of truth will not 
effulge in your mind, character and words. If there is no sun, a million 
lamps can't take away all the darkness. 
Propagating a truth, who speaks about his greatness, who is always busy 
with himself, who tries to show himself beautiful by various tricks, and 
whose pride bursts forth in every movement-in love, in words, in reliance
however vastly learned he may be and however much he may speak about 
wisdom and devotion-he is a hypocrite for sure. Stay far away from him. 
Don't listen to his words. There is no truth in his heart. How can feeling 
appear if there is no truth in the mind? 
Vanity in preaching is a hindrance to real preaching. A real preacher 
doesn’t, even by mistake, speaks of his own greatness, observes Truth in 
deed, and charmed by the honest thought in his mind, speaks about it 
according to his own conviction. 
Whenever you'll find anyone is speaking about Truth with the pride of 
conviction, has become restless with pleasure and humility while speaking 
about kindness, is calling and embracing all with love and emotion, and 
instead of yielding at the moment he is told of his own greatness, becomes 
pale, humble, and crestfallen as it were-know it verily-there lies blazing 
Truth in him and there you will find in his normal character too that Truth 
is ablaze. 
Do light the lamp of Truth with the wick of wisdom soaked in the oil of 
devotion! You will see how you will be surrounded by so many 
grasshoppers and insects, so many beasts and men. 
He who thinks of the Source of Existence only, speaks of the Source only, 
and loves Him only is the real preacher.  
If there is no deep faith in the Ideal, there is no constancy, no devotion. 
And if there is no devotion, how can there be realization? How can there 
be wisdom? What will he preach? 
The pride of a real preacher is his Ideal. The pride of a false preacher lies 
in self -preaching. 
When your heart will heave up with bursting zeal to speak what you know 
as good, what you know as Truth—with the mind unaffected by what 
people say about you, but feeling pleasure if you find men inclined 
towards Truth—that is preaching. 
Without real faith, constancy, and devotion, you can never be a real 
preacher.
