# MIND ATTACHED TO DIVINE IS DEVOTION


```
When the mind is fastened to worldly things, it is addiction. When it is 
attached to the Divine, it is devotion. 
Love is the gradual development of devotion. Concentration of devotion is 
love. The thinner the pride, the bigger the place for devotion. 
How can one succeed in avowed activity, without devotion? Devotion 
alone can bring success. 
As faith is never blind, so devotion is never stupid. 
In no way, at no time, is there weakness in devotion. 
Imbecility and weakness often appear in the garb of devotion. Beware of 
this.
