# OBSESSED EGO BRINGS FORTH ADDICTION


```
Obsessed ego brings forth addiction. Addiction breeds selfish interest. 
Selfish interest gives birth to passion. Passion is the source of anger, and 
anger begets violence. 
Devotion brings wisdom. In wisdom there is the sensing of self in 
creation. When there is this realization of self in creation. non-violence 
emerges, and from non-violence comes love. To the extent you possess 
any, you possess all.
