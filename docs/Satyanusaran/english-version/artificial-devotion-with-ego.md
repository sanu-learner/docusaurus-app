# ARTIFICIAL EMOTION IS MIXED WITH STIFF EGO


```
Artificial devotion is mixed with stiff ego. Real devotion is free from 
pride; i. e., it has a very thin pride. 
A man with counterfeit devotion cannot take advice. Adviser -like, he can 
only give advice. So if anyone advises him, signs of irritation, aversion 
and shirking the company appear clearly on his face. 
The man with real devotion is generally quite unwilling to play the part of 
an adviser and signs of pleasure blossom on his face if he gets advice. 
Devotion can never enter the heart of one who believes little and worships 
many. 
Devotion loves many for the One. Addiction loves the One for many. 
In addiction there is gratification from self-interest. In devotion there is 
satisfaction from interests for others. 
Devotion is concentric to the Source. Addiction seeks satiety in self
interest or ego. 
Addiction is the wife of passion, and devotion is the younger sister of 
love.
