# 49. RELY AND WORK


```
Rely and work on with boldness and indomitable enthusiasm. Beware that 
no misfortune come from anything in you to yourself or others. You shall 
find how the goddess of good fortune is tied down stationed in your house. 
It is said, "Fortune favours the brave." That's right. Faith. reliance and 
sacrifice: these three are the signs of bravery.
