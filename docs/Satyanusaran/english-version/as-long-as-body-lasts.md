# 54. AS LONG AS BODY LASTS


```
As long as body lasts, individuality also will last. So long as modes of 
mind remain, the ego persists. But the more passive one can remain, 
placing one's pride in the Ideal, the more self -less and tolerant he is. 
The less you brag of 'you', the better. The more you pride in the Ideal, the 
greater your good. 
Let the Supreme Father be your pride and enjoy bliss through Him. 
Don't place your pride in a false ideal; for then your ego will become even 
harder. 
The higher and broader the Ideal, the better. For, as high and broad your 
Ideal is, so high and broad you too become. 
Whenever you find people — especially the respectable—are bowing 
down at your feet and it doesn't elicit any great objection in you (you are 
sometimes hesitant with your words only, but not so much in your mind), 
know then and there for certain that self -adulation has stealthily entered 
your mind. Beware as soon as you can. Otherwise, you will fall for sure. 
Whenever anyone has bowed down at your feet and at once your head 
bows with humility and the mind is not ready at all to take service, rather 
it is eager to give service, and pleasure is felt in the heart only in speaking 
about the Ideal-no fear, you are in the lap of Bliss and always try to remain 
even more so.
