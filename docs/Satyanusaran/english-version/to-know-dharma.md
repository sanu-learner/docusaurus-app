# KNOWING DHARM IS TO KNOW ROOT CAUSE OF ANYTHING


```
To know Dharma is to know the root cause of anything, and to know that 
is wisdom. 
Attachment towards the Source is devotion, and wisdom is in proportion 
to the degree of devotion. Devotion and wisdom will be as much as is 
gained through that attachment. 
As much as you are attached to a subject, so much wisdom do you have 
about that subject. 
The purpose of life is to drive away want completely, and that is possible 
only by knowing the Cause. 
Exhausted in Want, the mind seeks Dharma or the Supreme Being; 
otherwise not. 
"What will remove want, and how?" From this thought the question of the 
Supreme Being arises at last. 
What upholds the existence of an object is Dharma. So long as that 
remains unknown, nothing is known exactly.
