# 46. FROM OBSESSED EGO COMES ADDICTION. 


```
From obsessed ego comes addiction. From addiction comes ignorance, 
and ignorance is misery. 
From doubt comes disbelief, and disbelief is dullness. 
From idleness comes stupidity, and stupidity is ignorance. 
Thwarted lust is anger, and anger is the friend of violence. 
The intention to satisfy passionate selfish interest is itself greediness, and 
this greediness is addiction. He who is not greedy is not addicted.
