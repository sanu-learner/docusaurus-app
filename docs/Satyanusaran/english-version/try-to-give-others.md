# 13. GIVE OTHERS, AS YOU DESIRE TO


```
Try to give others as you desire to have. To proceed with this 
understanding much is enough. Everyone will like you and love you 
spontaneously. 
Being just, try to make everyone happy in an honest way. You will find 
that many are trying to make you happy. Be careful—don't try to make 
anyone happy at the cost of your 'self’; then your troubles will know no 
end.
