# MOMENTARY EXCESS OF EMOTION, OUTBURST IS NOT THE SIGN OF A DEVOTEE


```
Exciting oneself in bouncings and pouncing or a little weeping on the 
impulse of dancing or singing etc. is sometimes taken for devotion. But 
this is not devotion at all. Momentary excess of emotion and outburst is 
not the sign of a devotee. There must be some sign of thin ego, sign of 
faith, signs of honest thought, good behaviour and broadness etc. in the 
character and conduct of a devotee; otherwise, devotion has not come. 
If there is no faith, there can be no adherence, and without adherence there 
can be no devotion! 
Vacillating, excessive ecstasy sometimes appears as devotion. Constancy 
is not there, and there is no telling sign of devotion. 
He in whose heart there lies devotion cannot know he is a devotee. He 
whose heart is weak, inconstant and only emotional, thinks with great 
pride, "I am a great devotee." 
It 
is not that devotion has appeared wherever tears, thrills of joy, 
perspiration and tremors have come. Along with these, devotion must have 
its own characteristic signs. 
Tears, thrills of ecstasy, perspiration, tremors etc. are signs of emotion that 
can be of many types. 
If, along with these signs of devotion, appear the characteristic ones of that 
state, then only is it a sign of the `sattvic' state- the state of divine life and 
good feelings.
