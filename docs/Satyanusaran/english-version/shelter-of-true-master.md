# SHELTER OF A TRUE MASTER


```
After taking the shelter of a true Master, think independently and express 
your own opinions respectfully. Reading books, don't become like a book. 
But try to breed its essence in your bones. â€œPull the husk to draw the 
seed." 
Don't pass any opinion on or give up anything after only superficial study. 
No real knowledge is gained about a thing until it has been seen 
thoroughly, and what opinion can you give if you have no knowledge 
about it? 
Whatever you do, try to see the truth in it. To see the truth in a thing 
means to know how it exists, and that is wisdom. 
About the things you do not know give no advice to others.
