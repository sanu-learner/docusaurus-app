# 53. HE WHO PREACHES HIMSELF


```
He who preaches himself deprives himself He who, enchanted with the 
Ideal, speaks about Him does really preach himself. 
The real preacher alone is the true well-wisher of the world. Limitless is 
the number of creatures that may find self -elevation through his kindness. 
Be charmed with the Ideal. Feeling will swell up in your heart 
spontaneously, and there is no knowing how many people will progress, 
being inspired by that feeling.  
Don't desire to be the Master; rather, try to be an adherent to Him. And 
one adhered to the Master is the real savior of lives.
