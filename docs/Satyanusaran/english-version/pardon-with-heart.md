# REPENT


```
Pardon, but with the heart. Filled with rage, don't forgive out of incapacity. 
Do not judge and punish on your own. But place it wholeheartedly before 
the Supreme Father; that will be good. 
If you punish anyone for his misdeed, surely the Supreme Father will mete 
out the punishment proportionately to you both. 
Suffer for the Supreme Father, for the Truth; you will enjoy eternal peace. 
Do dwell in Truth, try to forbear injustice and resist not what you have to 
forbear. You shall soon achieve good in the highest.
