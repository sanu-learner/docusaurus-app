# 29. IF COMMITTED ANY SIN


```
If you have committed any sin, confess it in anguish. You shall be 
consoled soon. 
Be careful! Do not suppress narrowness or sin. If you do, it will increase 
gradually and quickly lead you to extreme degradation. 
Whatever of evil you suppress within will increase.
