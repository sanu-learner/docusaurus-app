# BE ZEALOUS FOR SELF-ELEVATION


```
Be zealous for self-elevation and devote yourself to the Master or Truth. 
Be not attracted to what others are saying about you; otherwise, you will 
become attached to it and fail to have self -elevation. 
A selfish spirit often induces one to blame the Ideal, to doubt and to lose 
faith. Don't look for faults in the Ideal from a selfish spirit and don't doubt 
and don't lose faith. If you do, there'll be no self -elevation. 
But if being free of selfish spirit you find faults in a person, that person is 
no Ideal. Don't follow him. If you do, there'll be no self -elevation. 
He in whom infatuated pride, selfish thoughts, a lack of love exist is no 
Ideal. And he in whom doubt, faithlessness, and a selfish spirit exist is no 
follower. 
Follow, without hesitation, Him who is the possessor of love. You shall 
surely achieve your good! 
Follow only Him who tries by strength, skill or tact for the welfare of all 
created beings. You shall surely achieve your good! 
Follow Him alone who doesn't cause grief to anyone in any way, yet 
doesn't indulge evil. You shall achieve your good!
